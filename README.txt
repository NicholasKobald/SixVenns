Compiled on my windows machine with:

mingw32-make.exe

and run with: 

FHC <inputfilename>.txt > outputfilename.txt


-Currently modified to find ALL hamilton cycles in every 6-Venn. Will print out the number its found every time it doubles (this was my last experiment). This is easily modified by editing lines 35-40 of FHC.c.

-Comments should explain other things.
